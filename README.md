## Project Structure Notes

Some folders are automatically generated by Astro or development tools:

- `.astro/`: Astro internal cache and build data
- `.vscode/`: Editor configuration (optional)
- `node_modules/`: Project dependencies (ignored by Git)

These folders are not part of the application logic.
