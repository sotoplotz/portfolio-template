# STEP 1 — Astro Installation

## Issue

Astro requires an empty folder. Since we had existing project
documentation, a temporary folder was used for installation
and then merged with the project root.

## Result

- Astro installed successfully
- Documentation intact
- Dev server working at <http://localhost:3000>
