# Pages Structure & Routing

## Objective

Define the main pages of the portfolio using Astro file-based routing.

## Pages Created

- Home (`index.astro`)
- About
- Projects
- Skills
- Contact

## Design Decisions

- Each page uses semantic HTML5
- No shared layout yet to keep structure explicit
- Content is minimal and focused on structure
- Pages prepared for future layout and styling integration

## Academic Note

This step focuses on information architecture rather than visual design.
